Feasibility on Wastewater Sampling Services in Cotabato City

Wastewater sampling and analysis services in Cotabato City

Demo Link: 

Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is a newly established autonomous region in the southern island of the Philippines, along with its creation came many opportunities for new business ventures. One of the opportunities forseen by the researcher is the unavailability of third party laboratories that will cater the needs of industries registered on the region for their compliance requirements. It was evident on the reportial requirements submitted quarterly that these industries are not able to comply quarterly wastewater sampling and analysis. Which is punishable with penalties amounting to not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00) nor more than Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000.00) for every day of violation. This is especially hard for industries as they have to outsource the services outside of the region which is very costly. Considering this, the service is definitely in demand and has a potential to be profitable. The researcher proceeded with the study as he hopes to lobby the study to potential investors in order to help with the effective implementation of pertinent laws that govern the discharge of such wastes and lessen the burden for businesses and induustries in Cotabato City. The reasearcher selected this particular topic in the hopes to solve problems on both end of the waste water regulation scheme; the Bangsamoro government, which aims for a sustainable development and the Businesses/Industries in Cotabato City, which aims to gain profit all while complying to regulatory standards.

The researcher used data from various sources as enumerated on the following:
1. Wastewater Discharge Permit holders from Environmental Management Services (EMS) of the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) - BARMM as potential service receivers
2. Price quotation from third-party DENR accredited laboratories for direct costs if the service was to be provided
3. Other cost estimates for the costing
4. Survey: Is the market willing to pay for the service?
